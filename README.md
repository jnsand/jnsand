## Hello! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jonas Andersen

My coding journey started in C/C++ and has reached full stack development, including JavaScript, Go, Rust, etc.

Even today, 10 years later, I have a strong passion for programming and am still contributing to the community.

To produce the top-quality products, I follow best coding practices and constantly learn from other developers.

And I coached many junior developers, which allowed me to gain a solid grasp of knowledge.

While working remotely on startups and well-established corporations, I strengthened communication and teamwork.

Combining the Pomodoro method with task management tools, I improve the efficiency of work and meet the project deadline.

I also have the ability to identify the problems, brainstorm, and find the best solutions.

In my spare time, I solve leetcode problems to improve my data structure and algorithm skills.

I am looking for challenges to utilize my skills and experience.
