<p align="center">
  <div align="left" width="80%">
Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my code storage.
My programming journey started from C/C++ has reached the full stack development including JavaScript ecosystem, Go, Rust and etc.
Even today, 8 years later, I have a strong passion for programming and still contribute to the community.
In order to produce top quality products, I followed coding best practices and constantly learned from other developers.
And I coached many junior developers, which allowed me to gain solid grasp of knowledge
While working remotely on startups and well-established corporations, I strengthened communication and teamwork and kept the team moving at a very fast pace.
Combining the Pomodoro method with task management tools, I improve the efficiency of work and meet the dealine of the projects.
Also have ability to identify the problems, brainstorm and analyze answers and implement the best solutions.
I am looking for a great challenges to utilize my skills and experience.
In my spare time, I solve leetcode problems to improve my data structure and algorithm skills.
